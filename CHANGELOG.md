# Changelog

## 1.1.0

Additions for the plugin store (player 0.2.0; plugins that use them set `"minPlayerVersion": "0.2.0"`). Nothing existing changed.

- Manifest: optional display fields `name`, `author`, `punchline`, `description`, `tags`, `icon`, `readme`, `changelog`, `sourceUrl`, `license`, and `minPlayerVersion`. `PackageManifest` has them as optional properties.
- `plugin.packages.validateArchive(file)`: validate a `.vxp` package file.
- `PackageCandidate.install({ source, replace })`: where the package comes from (`repository`, `link`, `file`, `workshop`). Installing from the same source upgrades the plugin and keeps its data; another source fails with `conflict` unless `replace` is set. Built-in plugins fail with `unsupported`.
- `PluginInfo.builtin`, `PluginInfo.source`, `PluginInfo.dataDirectory`. Data directories are per installation now: read another plugin's data directory from `dataDirectory` instead of deriving it from the id.
- `plugin.ui.markdown(text, { base, remoteImages })` and `MarkdownRef`, for `MarkdownView` in the new `@vestra/markdown.slint` (also in `slint/`). Remote `https:` images are downloaded into the plugin's data directory.
- `TestHost`: `candidates`, `remoteImages`, `markdown()`; `packages` entries take the new fields (optional); `uninstall` and `install` follow the player's built-in and source rules; `packageCalls` records `install`.
- `vestra-plugin`: every command checks the manifest against the player's rules; `check` prints a hint for an id without an owner prefix; `build` copies the manifest's icon, README and changelog into `dist/`; `pack` writes `<id>-<version>.vxp` (was `.zip`; same content).
